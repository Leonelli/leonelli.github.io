# Biography
<!-- >--- -->

Matteo Leonelli is a Ph.D. fellow at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, supervised by Prof. Dr. Thorsten Holz. 
Prior to this, he earned an M.Eng. in Security from Saarland University (2024) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Trento University (2021). 
His research focuses on fuzzing, automated testing, and vulnerability discovery, with a particular emphasis on novel approaches for detecting unusual behaviors and bug categories.
<!-- He has published several papers in top-tier journals and conferences, such as NDSS... -->

>* **`Title`:** SBFT Tool Competition 2025 - Fuzzing Track
>* `Description`: Measuring fuzzer performance by aggregate coverage measurement loses a significant amount of information regarding a fuzzerâ€™s ability to explore a program. We introduced the concept of relcov, an asymmetric similarity metric based on the Tversky index, that allowed us to identify the the relative coverage-finding ability of one fuzzer in terms of another. Seeing that this metric uncovered far greater detail regarding the relationship between fuzzers, we designed a second metric, relscore, suitable for ranking a large number of fuzzers based on the novelty of the edges they discover and the reliability with which they do so. We used relscore as the basis for evaluating the rank of fuzzers during the SBFTâ€™25 competition, and in this report provide a deeper analysis using relcov.

>* **`Title`:** TwinFuzz: Differential Testing of Video Hardware Acceleration Stacks 
>* `Description`: TwinFuzz is a differential fuzz-testing approach to identify vulnerabilities in hardware acceleration stacks. We use a software proxy to guide the fuzz testing of the hardware acceleration stack for video decoding.

>* **`Title`:** Secure Pull Printing with QR Codes and National eID Cards: A Software-oriented Design and an Open-source Implementation 
>* `Description`: We design a software-oriented pull printing infrastructure that supports a print release mechanism using QR codes and electronic IDentity cards as a second-factor authenticator. Our solution addresses the costs, as any medium-size organisation can adopt our open-source solution without additional devices or access badges.
