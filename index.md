>* **`Title`:** Secure Pull Printing with QR Codes and National eID Cards: A Software-oriented Design and an Open-source Implementation 
>* `Description`: We design a software-oriented pull printing infrastructure that supports a print release mechanism using QR codes and electronic IDentity cards as a second-factor authenticator. Our solution addresses the costs, as any medium-size organisation can adopt our open-source solution without additional devices or access badges.
