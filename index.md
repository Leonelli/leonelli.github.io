<!-- >--- -->

>* **`Title`:** TwinFuzz: Differential Testing of Video Hardware Acceleration Stacks 
>* `Description`: TwinFuzz is a differential fuzz-testing approach to identify vulnerabilities in hardware acceleration stacks. We use a software proxy to guide the fuzz testing of the hardware acceleration stack for video decoding.
>* `Source`: [NDSS'2025(accepted)](https://github.com/CISPA-SysSec/twinfuzz)
>* `Tags`: [`Security`, `Paper`, `Conference`, `NDSS'2025`]

>* **`Title`:** Secure Pull Printing with QR Codes and National eID Cards: A Software-oriented Design and an Open-source Implementation 
>* `Description`: We design a software-oriented pull printing infrastructure that supports a print release mechanism using QR codes and electronic IDentity cards as a second-factor authenticator. Our solution addresses the costs, as any medium-size organisation can adopt our open-source solution without additional devices or access badges. 
>* `Source`: [CODASPY'2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3422337.3447847)
